Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
No more than 5 functions per file
You are allowed to use the C standard library
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project
##Compilation & Output
Your code will be compiled this way:
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
Any output must be printed on stdout
Any error message must be printed on stderr
Tests
We strongly encourage you to work all together on a set of tests

The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
##Mandatory tasks
0. push, pall
mandatory
Implement the push and pall opcodes.

The push opcode

The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.

Usage: push <int>
where <int> is an integer
if <int> is not an integer or if there is no argument given to push, print the error message L<line_number>: usage: push integer, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where is the line number in the file
You won’t have to deal with overflows. Use the atoi function
The pall opcode

The opcode pall prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.

Usage pall
Format: see example
If the stack is empty, don’t print anything
push 1$
push 2$
push 3$
pall$

1. pint
mandatory
Implement the pint opcode.

The pint opcode

The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

Usage: pint
If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pint, stack empty, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

push 1

push 2

push 3

2. pop
mandatory
Implement the pop opcode.

The pop opcode

The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.

Usage: pop
If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pop an empty stack, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

push 1
push 2

3. swap
mandatory
Implement the swap opcode.

The swap opcode

The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.

Usage: swap
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't swap, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

push 1
push 2
push 3

4. add
mandatory
Implement the add opcode.

The add opcode

The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.

Usage: add
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't add, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter

Implement the nop opcode.

The nop opcode

The opcode nop doesn’t do anything.

Usage: nop
